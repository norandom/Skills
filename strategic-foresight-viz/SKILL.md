  Strategic foresight and futures-analysis visualizations rendered through the draw.io MCP. Catalog covers 24 techniques across seven categories: environmental scanning (PESTLE / GRNO, Macro / Meso / Micro), trend analysis (Stage, Impact layered + temporal, Trend-on-Trend cross-impact, Countertrends & Cycles, Threat / Opportunity), weak signals & perception (See / Hear / Think / Feel, What / So What / Now What, Weak Signal Analysis I & II), basic scenario planning (Three Futures, Futures Cone, Dator's Four Archetypes), advanced scenario planning (Intuitive Logics, Lum's Four Steps, Layered Timeline), assessment frameworks (VUCA, CATUR, What If / Then cross-impact, Consequence Analysis), and comparative / historical (Analogical Reasoning, Stakeholder Analysis Lum). Triggers on requests for any foresight diagram, futures-analysis visualization, scenario planning chart, environmental scan, trend matrix, weak-signals map, or horizon-scanning artifact — including when the user describes the analysis without naming the technique. Also fires on PESTLE, VUCA / CATUR, scenario development, futures cone, stakeholder mapping for change initiatives, and analogical reasoning against historical precedents. Does not fire on intelligence-analysis techniques outside the foresight catalog (ACH, Pre-Mortem, Red Teaming, Cultural Web, Futures Wheel, Six Thinking Hats) — those route to intana-viz.

# Strategic Foresight Visualization Skill

Create strategic foresight and futures analysis visualizations using draw.io MCP tools. Each visualization opens directly in draw.io for viewing, editing, and export.

## Before Generating Any Visualization

1. Read `references/technique-catalog.md` to find the matching technique and its recommended diagram type.
2. Read `references/diagram-templates.md` to get the exact layout spec (canvas size, node positions, colors, style strings) for that diagram type. Follow the template precisely for visual consistency.
3. Read `references/use-cases.md` if the user needs help choosing the right technique for their foresight assessment.

## Available draw.io Tools

### 1. `mcp__drawio__open_drawio_xml` (Primary — most techniques)
Generates draw.io XML (mxGraphModel format). Supports precise positioning, custom shapes, colors, containers, layers. Use for:
- Environmental scanning matrices (PESTLE/GRNO)
- Trend stage matrices (Impact × Lifecycle)
- Cross-impact tables (Trend-on-Trend, What If/Then)
- Scored assessments (VUCA, CATUR)
- Hub-and-spoke diagrams (Perception Analysis)
- Futures Cone (concentric arcs)
- Dator's Archetypes (2×2 quadrant)
- Comparison tables (Three Futures, Analogical Reasoning)

### 2. `mcp__drawio__open_drawio_mermaid` (Flows and trees)
Generates Mermaid.js syntax. Best for:
- Process flows (Lum's Four Steps, What/So What/Now What)
- Decision trees and branching logic (If/Then chains)
- Hierarchical analysis (Macro/Meso/Micro decomposition)
- Stakeholder trees

### 3. `mcp__drawio__open_drawio_csv` (Tabular data)
Generates diagrams from CSV. Best for:
- Org-chart style hierarchies
- Simple relationship diagrams from tabular data

## User Inquiry Protocol

Before creating any diagram, ask the user for the specific data required by that technique. Each technique in the catalog lists the exact fields to inquire about. This ensures diagrams contain real analytical content rather than placeholder data.

**General inquiry pattern:**
1. Confirm the technique (or help them choose one using `references/use-cases.md`)
2. Ask for the data fields specific to that technique (listed in the catalog)
3. If the user provides unstructured text, extract entities and data points, show the extraction for confirmation, then generate

## Color Palette

Use these hex colors consistently across all diagrams:

```
Background:  #F8FAFC (light slate)
Card/Node:   #FFFFFF (white fill)
Border:      #334155 (slate-700)
Text:        #334155 (slate-700)
Accent:      #2563EB (blue-600) — primary highlights, current trends
Supporting:  #059669 (emerald-600) — positive outcomes, best case, opportunities
Warning:     #F59E0B (amber-500) — caution, emerging trends, likely case
Critical:    #DC2626 (red-600) — risks, worst case, collapse scenarios
Neutral:     #64748B (slate-500) — established trends, secondary items
Highlight:   #8B5CF6 (violet-500) — transformation, wildcards, uncertain
Grid/Axis:   #CBD5E1 (slate-300)
```

## Input Handling

### Structured Data
When the user provides scores, lists, or formatted data, map directly to diagram elements.

### Raw Text / Analyst Notes
When the user provides unstructured text:
1. Extract entities, relationships, and data points
2. Show the user what was extracted for confirmation
3. Generate the diagram

### Multiple Techniques
If the analysis requires multiple diagrams (e.g., a full foresight cycle), generate them sequentially, one tool call per diagram.

## Output

Call the appropriate draw.io MCP tool directly. The diagram opens in the user's draw.io editor. After opening, briefly explain what the diagram shows and how to modify it in draw.io.

## Fallback when draw.io MCP is unavailable

If `mcp__drawio__open_drawio_xml` / `..._mermaid` / `..._csv` are not registered, render the diagram as **Mermaid markdown** inside a fenced ```` ```mermaid ```` block in chat. Tell the user they can paste it into Typora, Obsidian, or VS Code with the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension. Many of the foresight techniques in this catalog rely on precise spatial layout (cones, swimlanes, 2×2 quadrants with named cells, multi-panel matrices) that Mermaid renders only approximately — emit the closest Mermaid equivalent (`flowchart`, `quadrantChart`, `gantt`, or simple grouped subgraphs) and call out the lost styling so the user knows the artifact is provisional. Do **not** write `.drawio` XML files to disk as a fallback.

## Routing to intana-viz

This skill owns the foresight catalog (24 techniques across the 7 categories listed in `references/technique-catalog.md`). When the user asks for an analytic technique outside that scope — ACH, Pre-Mortem, Red Teaming, Cultural Web, McKinsey 7S, Six Thinking Hats, Futures Wheel, Fishbone, Five Whys, Argument Mapping, etc. — hand off to the **intana-viz** skill instead of improvising. intana-viz has 80+ techniques catalogued with the same draw.io styling conventions.

Rule of thumb: if the request is about *anticipating the future* (trends, scenarios, weak signals, foresight assessments, environmental scans), stay here. If it is about *analyzing a hypothesis, decision, organization, or argument*, route to intana-viz. Some techniques sit at the boundary (What If / Then, Stakeholder Analysis) — this skill owns the foresight-flavored variants; intana-viz owns the intelligence-analysis variants.
