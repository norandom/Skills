  House style for quantitative Excel workbooks: sheet architecture, tab colors, menu and hyperlink navigation, semantic cell classes, named styles, number formats, the negative-value convention, dashboard and documentation standards, charts, and a definition-of-done audit. Four modes — CREATE a workbook, EXTEND one, AUDIT conformance (never writes), RESTYLE legacy formatting. Two non-mixable palette profiles: House Style (default, matching the corporate-finance blue/yellow convention — blue source data filled once, yellow assumptions the user tunes, no-fill calculations, light-gray outputs, navy key results) and Audit Standard (orange inputs, gray calculations, green font for mixed cells). Triggers on "standardize this workbook", "format my Excel model", "style this spreadsheet", "workbook house style", "tab colors", "build a menu sheet", "color-code inputs vs formulas", a Power Query load, or a formatting review. Applies to finance, risk, research, operations, and engineering assessments. Governs presentation only — it does not verify arithmetic.

# Financial modeling sheet: workbook house style

This skill governs how a quantitative workbook **looks and is organized**, not what it calculates. It answers one question at every cell: *what role does this play in the model, and how must that role be visible?*

A reader who has never opened the file should be able to tell, at a glance and without clicking a single cell, which numbers were typed, which were chosen, which were calculated, which came from an external engine, and which one is the answer.

Every sheet has the same skeleton: **rows 1–2 blank, the title on row 3, columns A and B empty, content anchored at column C.** That constant frame is what makes twenty sheets read as one workbook.

> Mode (CREATE / EXTEND / AUDIT / RESTYLE) -> palette profile -> semantic classification -> named styles -> navigation -> definition of done

It is domain-neutral. Financial models are the primary case, but the same architecture serves risk registers, research result sets, operations dashboards, statistical workbenches, and engineering calculation sheets.

## Prime directive: classify before you format

**Never apply one format to a whole used range.** Formatting is a claim about meaning. Applying a fill to a block you have not classified makes a false claim.

Three rules override everything else in this skill:

1. **Classify every cell or block by semantic role first** (`references/cell-classes.md`), then apply the matching named style. If you cannot name the role, do not color the cell.
2. **One palette profile per workbook, declared in Documentation, never mixed** (`references/palette-profiles.md`). The default is House Style. Mixing profiles makes the same fill mean two different things and destroys the reader's ability to audit at a glance.
3. **Preserve what is already coherent.** In EXTEND, AUDIT, and RESTYLE modes, formulas, cross-sheet references, charts, notes, named styles, column widths, hidden structures, and locally coherent formatting survive untouched unless the user explicitly asked for a full restyle. You are standardizing a workbook, not rebuilding it.

This skill does not verify arithmetic. Whether a number is *correct* is outside its scope; whether a reader can tell what that number **is** — typed, chosen, calculated, imported, decisive — is entirely inside it. When a request mixes the two, do the presentation work and say plainly which findings are formatting and which would need the math checked separately.

---

## Prime directive: lock the mode

Every request resolves to one of four modes. Identify it first and stay inside it.

| Mode | The user is saying | Primary output | Destructive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CREATE** | "build me a workbook for…" | a new workbook, fully styled from row 1 | no |
| **EXTEND** | "add a sheet / a module / a dashboard" | new blocks that match the existing house style | no |
| **AUDIT** | "check this workbook against the standard" | a conformance report, **no file changes** | no |
| **RESTYLE** | "standardize / clean up this workbook" | a changed workbook + a change log | **yes** |

AUDIT never writes. RESTYLE writes, so it needs an explicit go-ahead, a backup copy, and a change log listing every cell range touched. Do not drift from AUDIT into RESTYLE because the findings were obvious — report, then ask. The full mode contract, including the preservation list and the approval gates, is `references/mode-map.md`.

---

## When to use / when not

Use it to create a standardized quantitative workbook, add a conforming sheet to one, audit an existing workbook's structure and formatting, or normalize a legacy file that grew without a convention.

Skip it for: verifying the arithmetic itself, data cleaning and ETL, statistical method selection, presentation slides (`cobesy`), and diagrams (`drawio`). Skip it for a five-cell scratch calculation — the overhead is not worth it below roughly one screen of content.

---

## How to use this skill

1. **Lock the mode** (`references/mode-map.md`). CREATE, EXTEND, AUDIT, or RESTYLE. For EXTEND/AUDIT/RESTYLE, inspect first: sheet order, tab colors, view settings, used ranges, formulas, named styles, column widths, notes, charts, hidden sheets, and existing color conventions.
2. **Declare the palette profile** (`references/palette-profiles.md`). Default is House Style. If the workbook already follows the Audit Standard coherently, keep it and say so — do not convert a coherent workbook to the default profile without approval.
3. **Fix the architecture** (`references/workbook-architecture.md`). Sheet order, tab colors as a purpose code, gridlines and headings visible, no default freeze panes, **rows 1–2 blank and the title on row 3 on every sheet, columns A and B left empty, content anchored at column C**, method/source markers in a marker column to the right of each block.
4. **Build the shared inputs before anything downstream** (`references/sheet-standards.md`). They are the single source of truth — on their own sheet in a larger workbook, or as a block at the top of a task sheet in a small one. Every editable parameter lives there or in a clearly-marked scenario control, never buried in a formula.
5. **Classify and style each block** (`references/cell-classes.md`, `references/named-styles.md`). Nine semantic classes; apply the named style, not an ad-hoc fill. Where a named style exists in the workbook, reuse it rather than creating a parallel one.
6. **Apply typography, layout, and number formats** (`references/typography-and-layout.md`, `references/number-formats.md`). Arial for structure, Aptos Narrow for semantic styles. Leading minus for negatives, never red, never parentheses. Units in their own column.
7. **Normalize any Power Query output** (`references/power-query-data-sheets.md`). Its own `Data <n> <short id>` sheet at the end, loaded at `C6`, built-in table style stripped and replaced by the house header and body styles, a `PQ: <headline>` caption above the header row, column types set in the query — and everything downstream references it rather than copying it.
8. **Add charts only where a relationship is decision-useful** (`references/charts-and-tables.md`). XYScatter, XYScatterLines, or Line. No 3D. No decorative conditional formatting, no tables or pivots by default.
9. **Build navigation last** (`references/menu-and-navigation.md`). The menu is written *after* the tab order is final, and its order and swatches must match the actual tabs exactly.
10. **Run the checks** (`references/integrity-and-checks.md`). No `#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, or unexplained `#N/A`. Dashboard values link to source calculations. Every hyperlink resolves. No work-in-progress fills remain.
11. **Run the definition of done** (`references/audit-checklist.md`). The workbook is not deliverable until every line passes. In AUDIT mode this checklist *is* the deliverable.

This standard is applied **inside Excel**, through an assistant add-in (Claude for Excel, ChatGPT for Excel) driving the live workbook — not by generating a file offline. How to instruct the add-in, what units it reports, and the failure modes to watch for are in `references/implementation-excel-addin.md`.

## The style packet

Carry these fields across every phase and record them on the Documentation sheet.

| Packet field | Role |
|---|---|
| `M mode` | CREATE / EXTEND / AUDIT / RESTYLE |
| `P profile` | House Style (default) or Audit Standard — declared once, never mixed |
| `N naming` | the sheet-naming pattern for task sheets (numbered `Task 1…N`, or descriptive) — one pattern throughout |
| `T tab order` | the final sheet order; the menu is generated from this, not from memory |
| `S styles` | named styles present in the workbook, reused rather than duplicated |
| `C classes` | the semantic class assigned to each block, before any fill is applied |
| `U units` | unit and precision decision per row/table |
| `X external` | which blocks come from Python / an API / a solver / Power Query, and their marker-column labels |
| `D deltas` | in RESTYLE mode: every range changed, for the change log |

## Decision points

- **Which palette profile?** New workbook, or the user wants the semantic 9-class scheme -> House Style (the corporate-finance blue/yellow convention). Existing workbook already coherently using orange-input/gray-formula -> Audit Standard, keep it. Existing workbook on the old gray-source/orange-control house scheme -> the legacy house palette; match it, do not convert without approval. Never mix. (`references/palette-profiles.md`.)
- **Blue or yellow for this cell?** Is it data the world supplied, filled once — a historical actual, an opening balance, an observed or imported value, a value surfaced from the shared inputs -> blue `SourceData`. Is it an assumption or driver the user tunes to run a scenario -> yellow `Input`. Is it a constant fixed by the task or methodology -> gold `Constant`. A cross-sheet formula that *surfaces* an input into a parameter block is still blue — it is consumed there, not edited; role beats mechanism. (`references/cell-classes.md`.)
- **Output or Result?** Any calculated value a reader consumes -> light-gray `Output`. The value the decision turns on -> navy `Result`, white bold. The option actually chosen -> pale-green recommendation. If everything is navy, nothing is. (`references/cell-classes.md`.)
- **Freeze panes?** Default no. Add only when a sheet is long or wide enough that the header scrolls out of sight during normal reading. (`references/workbook-architecture.md`.)
- **A chart or a table?** Does the relationship between two metrics carry the message -> chart. Does the reader need the exact figures -> table. Decoration -> neither. (`references/charts-and-tables.md`.)
- **Table or formatted range?** Formatted range by default. Formal Excel table only when filtering, structured references, or aggregation genuinely require it — and for Power Query output, which necessarily lands as a table. (`references/charts-and-tables.md`.)
- **Where does this loaded data go?** Any Power Query output gets its own `Data <n> <short id>` sheet at the end of the workbook, is referenced rather than copied, and never edited in place — a refresh silently overwrites the edit. (`references/power-query-data-sheets.md`.)
- **Can this be delivered?** Only if every line of the definition of done passes and no WIP fill survives. (`references/audit-checklist.md`.)

## Cross-skill handoffs

| Sibling skill | Direction | Phase | What flows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reflect` | out | AUDIT | an ambiguous restyle request -> a resolved prompt before touching a live workbook |
| `premortem` | out | 10 | a finished decision workbook -> "how could this mislead a reader" failure modes |
| `cobesy` | out | delivery | a standardized workbook -> the rollout plan that gets the convention adopted |
| `drawio` | out | 3 | sheet architecture and data-flow between modules -> a workbook map diagram |
| `intana-viz` | out | AUDIT | conformance findings -> a structured-analytic view of where the model misleads |
| `humanizer` (external) | out | any | the written audit narrative -> de-AI'd prose ([github.com/blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer)) |
