name: game-theory-negotiation
version: 1.0.0
description: >
  Negotiation and auction playbook for bargaining, procurement, and incentive design. Use it to set the reservation price, BATNA, ZOPA, surplus, and aspiration ladder; plan degressive concessions instead of rigid take-it-or-leave-it offers; and run the live moves that matter: counter-offers, reversible noes, nibble defense, counter-nibbles, and higher-authority commitments. Covers virtual price lists for multi-issue trade-offs, scenario analysis, three- and four-point BATNA estimates, holdup protection, fairness criteria, win-win checks, Vickrey-style mechanisms, negotiauctions, profit-share sizing, and draw.io maps of players, incentives, information gaps, moves, and payoffs. Triggers on requests to prepare for or run a negotiation, choose an opening offer or concession pattern, defend a walk-away price, improve a BATNA, price a non-cash concession, structure a tender, design a bonus, stop last-minute renegotiation, split something fairly, test whether a deal is truly win-win, or visualize the negotiation as a game. Also fires on phrases like "help me negotiate", "what should I open with", "how much should I counter", "they're asking for one more concession", "is this a fair split", "design the incentive", "BATNA", "ZOPA", "reservation price", "degressive bidding", "negotiauction", "game tree", "payoff matrix", and "draw this negotiation". Does not fire on general game-theory homework unrelated to bargaining, auctions, or contracting.

# Game-theoretic negotiation and auctions

This skill turns game theory into a negotiation workflow: set the numbers, choose the tactic, run the concession plan, defend the close, and check the result. Use it when a negotiation needs structure instead of vibes.

## Prime directive: aim above your floor, never at it

Two findings anchor everything else in this skill:

1. **Your reservation price is a floor, never a target.** It is the worst outcome you would still accept. The other side would love to push you there. Keep it in the back of your mind as a hard boundary, not as a place to bargain.

2. **Focus on the Ambitious Target (AT), not the floor.** Negotiators who aim at an ambitious but plausible target tend to do better than negotiators who stare at their walk-away point. You usually end up near what you aim at.

Everything below keeps you in the useful zone between the Ambitious Target and the floor. The goal is simple: claim more of the surplus without blowing up the deal.

Read `references/core-concepts.md` before any non-trivial negotiation prep. It defines the numbers (reservation price, BATNA, ZOPA, surplus, aspiration levels) the rest of the skill manipulates.

## How to use this skill

1. **Frame the situation.** Is it distributive (one issue, fixed pie) or integrative (several issues, trade-offs possible)? One-shot or repeated? Bilateral negotiation, or a tender / negotiauction? Ask only if the answer changes the move.
2. **Set the numbers** (`references/core-concepts.md`). Establish your reservation price, sharpen your BATNA, estimate the ZOPA, and lay out the aspiration ladder: BPO, Ambitious Target, Target, Reservation Level, No-Deal Outcome. If the BATNA is uncertain, model it with a three- or four-point estimate (`references/frameworks.md`).
3. **Plan the bidding** (`references/tactics.md`). Choose **degressive bidding** by default; place the target price in the *middle* of the bargaining range, pick a plausible maximum opening position, and pre-compute the halving concession schedule plus the closing in-kind sweetener. Reject Boulwarism unless you understand exactly why you're using a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
4. **Hold the line with tactics** (`references/tactics.md`). Always answer with a counter-offer. Use a reversible no to buy time and escape the red zone. Keep higher authority in reserve for face-saving and rule enforcement.
5. **Value non-price terms** with a virtual price list (`references/frameworks.md`) so you can trade across issues and convert any concession into money.
6. **Defend the close.** Watch the window between handshake and signature for nibbles and holdup; apply price-tagging, counter-nibble, or the threat to reopen everything (`references/tactics.md`, `references/frameworks.md`).
7. **Verify the outcome.** Confirm it is genuinely **win-win**, not merely Pareto-tolerable; check the surplus split against your aspiration levels; for fairness disputes apply an explicit criterion such as Cut-and-Choose (`references/frameworks.md`).
8. **For auctions, procurement, and incentive design**, go to `references/frameworks.md` (negotiauctions, incentive-compatible mechanisms, incentivization / profit-share).
9. **For diagrams**, use `references/drawio-concepts.md`. Pick the diagram from the work product: player/incentive map for stakeholder alignment, information-asymmetry map when truthfulness is uncertain, move tree for sequences, payoff matrix for choices, and deal-architecture map for multi-issue trades.

Use the templates in `assets/` to capture the prep and run a live session.

When another skill has already analyzed the same situation, carry forward its context packet instead of starting over: actors, claims, evidence, assumptions, scenarios, constraints, options, payoffs, and open questions. Keep the same names for actors and claims so diagrams from different skills can be compared side by side.

For a new negotiator, do not start with tactics. Walk them through `references/prep-walkthrough.md` first. The output should be a ready-room brief: what they want, what they can accept, what they must verify, what they will open with, what they will concede, what they will say no to, and what diagram they should keep open during the conversation.

## Capability map

The course's capabilities sort into four layers. Each row points to where it lives.

### A. Core action capabilities (live tactical moves) -- `references/tactics.md`
- **Counter-offer** -- never just reject; propose a new number or term and flip yourself back into the proposer role.
- **Reversible no** -- reject one proposal without killing the deal, then use the pause to build a better counter.
- **Nibble defense** -- price-tag the late ask, counter-nibble, or threaten to reopen the whole negotiation.
- **Higher authority** -- bind yourself to an absent approver so you can buy time, save face, and enforce rules.

### B. Frameworks and analytical tools -- `references/frameworks.md`
- **Degressive bidding vs Boulwarism** -- use shrinking concessions by default; avoid rigid first-and-final offers unless the breakdown risk is acceptable.
- **Virtual price list** -- assign money values to non-price terms so you can trade across issues.
- **Scenario analysis** -- separate risk, uncertainty, and surprises instead of pretending one forecast covers everything.
- **Three-point / four-point estimates** -- model an uncertain BATNA instead of guessing one number.

### C. Strategic mindsets -- `references/core-concepts.md`
- **Target focus** -- anchor on the Ambitious Target, not the floor.
- **Risk-aversion modeling** -- discount uncertain outcomes by the decision-maker's risk attitude.
- **Win-win verification vs Pareto efficiency** -- a deal both sides accept is not automatically jointly optimal.

### D. Operational applications -- `references/frameworks.md`
- **Holdup protection** -- mutual exposure, automated triggers, milestones, and self-binding contracts.
- **Fairness-criterion negotiation** -- pick the criterion explicitly: contribution, productivity, voting, or Cut-and-Choose.
- **Incentive-compatible mechanisms and negotiauctions** -- Vickrey-style truthful auctions, strategic bidding, and rule-bound procurement.
- **Incentive design** -- profit-share and bonus sizing, with attention to the right variable component.

### E. Cross-skill and draw.io work -- `references/drawio-concepts.md`
- **Game-theory diagram selection** -- choose a player map, information map, move tree, payoff matrix, or deal map based on the decision.
- **Foresight handoff** -- import scenarios, weak signals, and external uncertainties from `strategic-foresight-viz` before pricing risk or estimating BATNA.
- **Investigation handoff** -- import claims, evidence, gaps, and deception risks from `investigation-theory` before trusting stated preferences or constraints.
- **Hypothesis testing handoff** -- route contested assumptions through `intana-viz` techniques such as ACH, Red Teaming, Key Assumptions Check, or Pre-Mortem.

## When the negotiator is stuck

- **You keep landing near your floor.** You are fixating on the reservation price. Re-anchor on the Ambitious Target and use a Tactical No to climb out of the red zone.
- **They opened first and anchored high/low.** Don't argue the anchor. Make a counter-offer that re-anchors from your side; whoever issues the last credible ultimatum holds the power.
- **One non-price demand is blocking a money deal.** Put it on the virtual price list and trade it; isolate it from the agreed core.
- **Your BATNA feels weak.** Invest in improving it before conceding. Every better outside option shrinks the zone in your favor. If it's uncertain, estimate it with three or four points rather than guessing a single number.
- **They're nibbling at the altar.** Price-tag it, counter-nibble, or threaten to reopen everything. Nibblers fear a full reopening.
- **The "fair" split is contested.** Stop arguing fairness in the abstract; agree on a *criterion* first (Cut-and-Choose is self-enforcing for two parties).
